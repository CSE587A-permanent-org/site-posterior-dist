# Site Posterior

You will find the assignment instructions in
[site_posterior/assignment.ipynb](site_posterior/assignment.ipynb). As with the
other labs, the only code which will be graded is in
[site_posterior/assignment.py](site_posterior/assignment.py). You need to write
code in that file such that the tests in
[site_posterior/test_assignment.py](site_posterior/test_assignment.py) pass.
